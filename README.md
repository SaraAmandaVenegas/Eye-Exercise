# Eye-Exercise
This is my work for the Eye Exercise form Module 8.

# How to Run:
Go to the Eye-Exercise repository.
-Select "Clone" to clone files onto your computer.
-Go to your file browser on you computer.
-Open cloned Eye-Exercise file folder.
-Select the index.html and open using your internet browser.

# Future Improvements:
I think it would be neat to add a feature where the eyes blink apon a mouse click.
